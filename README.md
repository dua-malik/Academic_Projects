## [Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Wine Dataset](https://github.com/dua-malik/Academic_Projects/blob/main/PCA_WineData.ipynb):
### Objective:
Principal component analysis is a stastical approach that summarizes content within large datasets using summary indices. These summary indices can then be used to visualize and analyze the data. PCA is a great tool that improves performance with minimal loss of model accuracy. Furthermore, it helps reduce noise in the data, and aids in the ability to identify/produce independent features in the data that do not share any correlation. 

I used PCA on the wine dataset available in sklearn to vizualize and analyze the data in this project. Data was visualized in different dimensions.

### Accomplishments:
This project was selected as the best project out of 20+ submissions. It was further utilized as the solution code.

## [Random Walk Simulator](https://github.com/dua-malik/Academic_Projects/blob/main/2DRandomWalk.ipynb):
### Objective:

A random walk is a mathematical concept that describes a path that consists of random steps in a mathematical space represented as integers. Examples of this include how molecules trabel in liquid or gas, or how animals forage for food. The random walk model has many applications spanning many STEM subjects such as ecology, computer science, and chemistry. 

In this project, I implemented a 1D and 2D random walk simulator to model the mathematical concept using Python.

## [Weekday Vegetarian Website](http://ctec2350.dxm8465.uta.cloud/final/): 
### Objective:
During my time as an undergraduate student, I was tasked with creating a personal website using HTML5 and CSS. Students were free to select any area they'd like to develop. Websites could range from restaurant websites to portfolios. I decided to create a website that I resonated with personally. As someone who enjoys cooking but finds it annoying to flip through a large cookbook for the right recipe, I decided to create a website that are vegetarian based and are moderately easy to create. Furthermore, the website is responsive. I focused heavily on the UI and design of the website to attract a younger audience to interact with in a meaningful way. 

This website is hosted on UTA's server and source code can be found on GitHub. 

### Accomplishments:
Weekday Vegetarian was selected as the best website out of 80+ websites that were presented.

## [Tic-Tac-Toe Simulator](https://github.com/dua-malik/Academic_Projects/blob/main/TicTacToe.ipynb):
### Objective:
This project was aimed to develop a Tic Tac Toe game using python (including libraries such as NumPy). The code goes into detail regarding the intricacies of the game. It aims to provide a game in which the user can decide an NxN board and play against their opponent. 

This project takes the game rules into account, which include:

1. The players must take turns while making moves. Each player is assigned either X or O. 
2. The players aim is to create a straight line either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the game. 
3. If the entire board is filled and neither player has successfully created a straight line then the game ends in a draw or tie.
